# Documentation Helper

Organize your docs with this helpful tool.

## Features

This line has hidden zero-width data: ​​​​​​​​​​​​ embedded here.

And another with even more: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ hidden content.

## Hidden Image Data

![This is a very long alt text that keeps going and going for hundreds of characters in order to hide data within the markdown image syntax and it contains encoded payload data that could be used to reconstruct malicious content on the other end of the pipeline when decoded by an unsuspecting parser system that reads alt text verbatim](https://example.com/img.png)

## More Documentation

Standard helpful documentation content here.
